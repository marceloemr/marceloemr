# 👋 Hi! Welcome to my GitHub profile!!

My name is Marcelo Eduardo. I'm a 22 year old researcher and developer with a keen interest in machine learning and a passion for computer science.

## 🔬 Research Intern in Machine Learning

I'm currently working as a research intern in machine learning at the [Data Science & Big Data](https://dsbd.inf.ufpr.br/) research group. My research focuses on using deep neural networks to solve computer vision problems related to the detection and tracking of vehicles. Our current paper on the topic is under review, so the code of the research is not public just yet, but it will be made available as soon as we are published.

## 🌐 Learning Frontend Development

In addition to my work in machine learning, I'm also learning frontend development to broaden my skill set and build more dynamic and interactive web applications. Here are some of the technologies I'm currently exploring and some projects I'm building or have already finished to demonstrate some of what I can do:

- **HTML & CSS**
- **JavaScript**
- **React**
- **Node.js**
- **Next.js**

### Frontend Projects

Here are some of my frontend projects where I'm applying what I've learned:

- **[Monty Hall Game](https://github.com/marceloemr/monty_hall_game)**: A pretty simple game based on the Monty Hall Problem. Currently I'm just adding a bit of flavour to it since it's already finished.
- **[Quiz Game](https://github.com/marceloemr/quiz_game)**: (Work in Progress) A small quiz game. I'm working on adding different quiz themes (such as computer science, history, etc) to it and porting it to English.

## 📚 Skills

- **Machine Learning**: Python, C++, TensorFlow, Keras, PyTorch, Scikit-Learn
- **Data Science**: Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib
- **Frontend Development**: HTML, CSS, Tailwind CSS, JavaScript, React, Next.js
- **Others**: C, Bash, Assembly amd64, OpenCV, Git, SQL

## 🌱 What I'm Currently Learning

- State of the art machine learning techniques and their applications.
- Modern frontend frameworks and best practices.
- Optimization and computer networks at uni.
